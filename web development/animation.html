	<p>Being a menacing presence in the Shadowood, his matted, filthy purple-gray fur and red, beeping eyes give him an unpleasant appearance. Even when he twitches constantly he still chases you with a weak left leg at an interesting quick pace (giving his name to be Whip). He however enjoys more lurking around in the forest for his prey giving him an air of unnerving energy, a mix of mischievousness and cunning. Even though Whip has a disturbing appearance, he has a magnetic quality that draws people to him despite making them uncomfortable with his unsettling presence.</p>
