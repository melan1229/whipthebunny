    <p>Although all the pages can be a little scary to dive into and learn about this mysterious bunny man we call Whip that loves to take people to an unknown world. I want to prove to others that all this is real and I'm not delusional so i created this little section or you to play in and let loose for a moment because I want to show people that this is all genuine and that I'm not crazy. However, if you really want to learn more about him and the reason he's with us, you can also find and assist us in doing so. You will receive the precise coordinates of his tree hut. Even so, you must act quickly to catch it.</p>
